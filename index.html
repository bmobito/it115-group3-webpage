                        <p>In the video game industry, the market for home video game consoles has frequently been segmented into generations, grouping consoles that are considered to have shared in a competitive market place. Since the first home consoles in 1972, there have been nine defined home consoles generations.</p>
                        <p>A new console generation typically occurs approximately every five years, in keeping pace with Moore’s law for technology, though more recent generations have had extended periods due to the use of console revisions rather than completely new designs. </p>
                        <p>Consoles considered to be significant competition with one another are classed into generations. Systems such as <a href="#handheld">handheld consoles</a> are often omitted from these generations</p>

                    <div class="full margin_top_20">
                        
                        <p style="color:white">In 1966, Ralph H. Baer, an engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanders_Associates">Sanders Associates</a>, pitched an idea for a device that could use a television to play games.  After pitching the idea to multiple companies/sectors, TV manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox">Magnavox</a> picked it up.</p>
                        <p style="color:white">In 1972 Magnavox released the Odyssey Video Game Unit into the US market.  The Odyssey used analog circuitry (transistors and diodes) and was quite limited.  It could display: </p>
                        <ul style="color:white" class="list">
                        <li style="color:white" class="item">A vertical bar</li> 
                        <li style="color:white" class="item">2 boxes whose position was controlled by each of the wired ‘controllers’</li>
                        <li class="item">1 box whose position was controlled by settings on the console</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="color:white">The games were simple and some required plastic overlays placed over the screen to give context similar to a game board.  The Odyssey retailed for $100 and sold 69,000 units in the first year. Eventually 300,000 units were sold worldwide. </p>
                        <p style="color:white">Odyssey pioneered many of the features that are common to gaming devices. One of those features was the pluggable modules to extend game functions. These modules are similar to cartridges in more modern consoles but modified the analog circuits rather than code for digital processors. Magnavox also released the Shooting Gallery accessory pack that included the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_gun">light gun</a> gaming device and four shooting games. </p>

                        <p>The second generation of gaming consoles was defined by inexpensive integrated circuits and swappable game cartridges which expanded the game libraries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari">Atari</a>, a successful arcade game manufacturer created the Atari Video Computer System (rebranded Atari 2600) which retailed for $200. It became the most popular console in the second generation, selling over 30 million units.</p>
                        <p>In 1979, Atari’s four lead game developers left the company to found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a> and became the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#Third-party_developers">third party computer game publisher</a>. After Atari sued Activision for stealing trade secrets, Activision settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay royalties to publish games on the platform.

The Sony PlayStation was the brainchild of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kutaragi">Ken Kutaragi</a>, who was a Sony executive at the time.</p>
                        <p>Although the console started as a partnership between Sony and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, Nintendo abruptly cancelled the partnership and replaced Sony with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Phillips</a> a day after announcing the partnership. This infuriated the C.E.O. of Sony, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norio_Ohga">Norio Ohga</a>, and thus Sony Computer Entertainment (now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>) was formed by Ohga and Kutaragi to compete with Nintendo.</p>
                        <p>The PlayStation was released in 1995 and was a smash hit. It became the first console to sell over 100 million units. Hindsight is always 20/20 but being rejected by Nintendo became the best thing that ever happened to Sony.</p></p>
