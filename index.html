                    <div class="full margin_top_20">
                        <p>In 1966, Ralph H. Baer, an engineer at Sanders Associates, pitched an idea for a device that could use a television to play games.  After pitching the idea to multiple companies/sectors, TV manufacturer Magnavox picked it up.</p>
                        <p>In 1972 Magnavox released the Odyssey Video Game Unit into the US market.  The Odyssey used analog circuitry (transistors and diodes) and was quite limited.  It could display: </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>A vertical bar</li> 
                        <li>2 boxes whose position was controlled by each of the wired ‘controllers’</li>
                        <li>1 box whose position was controlled by settings on the console</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The games were simple, and some required plastic overlays placed over the screen to give context similar to game board.  The Odyssey retailed for $100 and sold 69,000 in the first year. And eventually 300,000 units worldwide. </p>
                        <p>Odyssey pioneered many of the features that are common to gaming devices. with pluggable modules to extend the game functions. These modules are similar to cartridges in more modern consoles, but they contained analog that modified the analog circuits rather than code for digital processors. Magnavox also released the Shooting Gallery accessory pack that included the first “light gun” gaming device and four shooting games. </p>

                        <p style="color:white">The second generation of gaming consoles was defined by inexpensive integrated circuits and swappable game cartridges which expanded the game libraries. Atari, a successful arcade game manufacturer created the Atari Video Computer System (rebranded Atari 2600) which retailed for $200. It became the most popular console in the second generation, selling over 30 million units.</p>
                        <p style="color:white">In 1979, Atari’s four lead game developers left the company to found Activision and became the first 3rd party computer game publisher. After Atari sued Activision for stealing trade secrets, Activision settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay royalties to publish games on the platform. Third party publishers follow this same business model today.</p>

                        <p>The fourth generation of game consoles was headlined by the Sega Genesis. It was the first console to truly adopt 16 bit graphics and was seen by the gaming community as a huge leap forward. It featured games such as Mortal Kombat and Sonic the Hedgehog. Even though Sega eventually failed as a console manufacturer the Sega Genesis is remembered for pushing, through healthy aggressive competition, Nintendo which at the time of the Genesis’s launch had an over 90% market share in the home console market. An enduring legacy of the Genesis is the ESRB stickers (parental advisory) that are on every single game sold in the U.S. in response to the violent nature of some of their games.</p>

Thus Sony Computer was formed from the C.E.O. of Sony Music and Ken Kutaragi to compete with Nintendo. Playstation was released in 1995 and was a smash hit. It became the first console to sell over 100 million units. Hindsight is always 20/20 but being rejected by Nintendo became the best thing that ever happened to Sony.</p>

                        <p>The sixth generation of video games was defined by the highest selling video game console of any kind to date. With over 155 million units sold and when you compare the 2 closest competitors of its generation (Nintendo GameCube 22 mil., Microsoft Xbox 24 mil.) which combined are short of 50 million it is fair to say it blew the doors off its competition. PS2 owes its success to many factors. First at the time the average cost of DVD players was 900$ and PS2 had DVD capability at $299 giving even non gamers reason to purchase the console. Second it was the first console to allow backwards compatibility and allowed PS1 gamers (and its over 100 million console owners) to play there PS1 games on the PS2. Third it had a broad assortment of game developers pledged to produce games for the system. All these factors contributed to the most successful console to date.</p>

This was followed by the release of Sony Computer Entertainment’s PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006 and Nintendo’s Wii on November 19, 2006 the following year. The seven generation slowly began to wind down when Nintendo began cutting back on Wii production in the early 2010s.</p>
                        <p style="color:white">In the video game industry, the market for home video game consoles has frequently been segmented into generations, grouping consoles that are considered to have shared in a competitive market place. Since the first home consoles in 1972, there have been nine defined home consoles generations.</p>
                        <p style="color:white">A new console generation typically has occurred approximately every five years, in keeping pace with Moore’s law for technology, though more recent generations have had extended periods due to the use of console revisions rather than completely new designs. </p>
                        <p style="color:white">Not all home consoles are defined as part of this generation; only those considered to be significant competitive consoles are classed into generations, and systems such as microconsoles are often omitted from these generations. </p>
